# Aph-py
The repo for my small AI/Chatbot project, Aph. This is the origional version written in python; Aph has since been [ported to node](https://github.com/Lukalot/Aph).
The name means Anthropomorphizing Parodist Heuristic bot (inspired by [HAL 9000's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000#Origin_of_name))

# Use
To run, simply download the source code and start `RUN.bat` or do `python path_to_folder/aph.py`
Typing messages into the program console will cause Aph to respond to and store/learn from your responses.
